## How to play
Roll the dice to start your turn.

If you get a 6, you will get another roll of the dice.

At the same time, you can summon 1 horse to the field at the starting point.

Rolling any dice 1-6, you can let any summoned horse move in a counter-clockwise direction from right to left.

If you get 1, you can let the horse jump quickly over the ending points.

You can eliminate (kick) the opponent's horse when the position of the horse you move forward coincides with the position of the opponent's horse.

When you reach the end point, you can level the horse to level 3-6.

When all the horses level up as soon as possible, you will win with a total of 18 points.
